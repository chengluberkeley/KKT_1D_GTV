# KKT_1D_GTV

This repo implements the algorithm in the paper [A unified approach for a 1D generalized total variation problem. Mathematical Programming, February, 2021.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-021-01633-2)

The problem to be solved is of the form:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\text{(1D-GTV)}\quad\min_{x_1,\ldots, x_n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i) %2B \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} h_i(x_i - x_{i %2B 1})">

Both <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_i(x_i)"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=h_i(x_i - x_{i %2B 1})"> functions are arbitrary convex functions.

For all the above experimental results:
* Each average is taken by 5 runs of randomly (if not specified) generated data and coefficients.
* All runs are on a MacBook (Big Sur) of 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4 memory.

## Run prebuilt executable
For a sample run of all special case problems implemented:
```
cd bin
./run.sh
```
It will output runtime profiles in the `/tmp/` folder.

To see the full runtime arguments,
```
cd bin
./kkt_main
```

## Build from the source
